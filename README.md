# Untitled-Python-Game
A small project that I hopefully will finish, intended to be a top-down game
This project is an independent effort. The sprites used are of my own making with the website Piskel, and I used pygame for a lot of what I currently have. 
Just as a precaution, this project is not to be shared or edited without my express permission. Thank you!
